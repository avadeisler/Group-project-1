WITCHY WEATHER: TODAY'S SPELLCAST

This is the first group project that we have been assigned in our Full stack coding bootcamp.
We were tasked with creating a functional and creative app using the skills we have gained this far. 

Our group includes Noah Meister, Olivia Skillings, Carlos Asencio Morales and Ava Deisler.

We decided to create an app called Witchy weather. This app combines several pieces of astronomical data such as the current phase of the moon, constellations above you based on your location, moon rise, moon set, as well as the chance of meteor showers and other space weather. With this information, any modern day witch or warlock will be able to ascertain the best time for spell casting! Click on the cute cat for a daily cat fact!

There are some guidelines that were assigned to us by the bootcamp staff:

Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. - We decided to use Tailwind.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input). - click the kitty!
Also, it will track your location in order to tell you your constellations.

Use at least two server-side APIs. - We used several. One for random cat facts. One for moon phases. One for space weather.

Must include one modal. It does not use native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality. - Ours took the form of a speech bubble for our random cat facts.

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive. - Our witch cat button, our location which shows your current moon cast and constellations.
